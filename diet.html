<h2><a href="#">Diet</a></h2>
<p>Tigers mainly eat ambar deer, wild pigs, water buffalo and antelope. Tigers are also known to hunt sloth bears, dogs, leopards, crocodiles and pythons as well as monkeys and hares. Old and injured tigers have been known to attack humans and domestic cattle.</p>

									<p>The Panthera tigris diet includes a large diversity of animals that are typically medium to large usually weighing more than 200 pounds, and even dare to attack other predators and animals of considerably larger size than theirs. Small animals make up a tiny part of their usual diet.

Tigers can stay up to two weeks without food, but when they catch prey, they can eat 75 pounds of meat at once.</p>
</p><a href="#"> <img style="width:928px" src="https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA2Mi81MjMvb3JpZ2luYWwvdGlnZXItYXR0YWNrLmpwZw==" /> </a>
<p>The animals they consume most are ungulates, those with hooves, which weigh more than 200 pounds as we said before. Among them, deer and wild pigs are some of the most common although the prey is different in every region.

For example, those living in regions of India consume the following species: Sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), Barasingha or Swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii), wild boar (Sus scrofa), chital (Axis axis), wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), blue bull or Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and gaur or Indian bison (Bos gaurus).</p>
				
<p>
In the Siberian region, tigers feed on the Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus), Sika Deer (Cervus nippon), Siberian Roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), Moose (Alces alces) and Musk deer (Moschus). At Eastern Russia, they include brown bear (Ursus arctos) and Tibetan bear (Ursus thibetanus). However, those tigers confined to the island of Sumatra feed on sambar deer, muntjac (Muntiacus), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and wild boar.

Also, when needed, they can consume carnivores such as leopards, python snakes, crocodiles and wild dogs. Although out of the weight range of their usual prey, they can complement their diet with small species like monkeys, porcupines, fish and even some species of birds. Occasionally they attack the offspring of other mammals, and if there is scarcity, they may eat carrion, attack domestic livestock or even humans. However, it is important to know that although there have been reported cases of anthropophagy, they are unusual events driven by extraordinary circumstances, in addition to the lack of food.</p>
